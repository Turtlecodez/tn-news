    <h2>latest drama in TN</h2>
    <h3>the kelsea drama</h3>
    <p>wearr's summarization:
      "essentially
lied about being trans
lied about age
lied about pretty much everything about themselves
convinced me to date them while lying about themselves
eventually randomly left me for scaratek without notice
then decided to be trans publicly and be honest about their age, but not with me still. I had to get the info about their age from other people
It was a disgusting situation and it's pretty much the entire reason I have an extreme distrust and general dislike of trans people"
